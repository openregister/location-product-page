          %p As a high profile site, #{link_to "https://petition.parliament.uk"} needs to be accurate and up-to-date wherever possible. So when we were given the chance to remove one more static set of data with an API we jumped at the chance. This is because having an authoritative list that updates automatically eliminates a huge amount of effort when validating data. We were able to identity a number of places where we had used the wrong country name previously.
